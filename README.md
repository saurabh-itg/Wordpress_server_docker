# Wordpress_server_docker
This project aims to simplify the process of setting up a local WordPress development environment using Docker containers. Docker containers allow you to encapsulate the entire WordPress stack, including the web server, database, and other dependencies, ensuring consistent and isolated development environments across different systems.
